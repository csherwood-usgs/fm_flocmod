Matlab version of FlocMod
Adapted by Chris Sherwood from Romaric Verney
Romaric.Verney@ifremer.fr

The initial Matlab version is based on Flocmod_crs,
a FORTRAN version of FlocMod by Verney.

Verney et al. (2011) Behaviour of a floc population during a tidal cycle:
Laboratory experiments and numerical modeling.
Continental Shelf Research 31:564-583.

The initial version in this repo does not exactly
reproduce the results from flocmod_crs and is wicked slow.

Later versions will hopefully be validated and run faster.
